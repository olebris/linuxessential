- **Link Layer**
Handles the communication between directly connected devices.
- **Network Layer**
  - Handles routing outside of individual networks and the unique addressing of devices beyond a
single link layer network.
  - packet switching. Data is grouped up with a header, which contains information about where the information is coming from and where it’s going to.
- **Application Layer**
Enables individual programs to connect to each other.

## Link Layer Networking

- use MAC address to identify network cards
- `ip link show` display network interfaces / MAC addresses

## IP v4

- 32-bit addresses for routing
- `11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001` =  192.168.0.1 :  4 digits of 8 bit = 32-Bit
- Now for this IP address, the subnet mask sets each bit which belongs to the network part to 1 and
each bit that belongs to the host part to 0
- Subnet mask :  255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 = 192.168.0.1/24 : allow 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255
- Subnet mask CIDR notation = 192.168.0.1/24
- Private Network:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12
  - 192.168.0.0/16
- Network Address Translation (NAT) : map internal adresses to single external IP or external IP to internal addresses
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for automatic IP configuration
- `ip addr add` add manually a new ip eg.: `sudo ip addr add 192.168.0.5/255.255.255.0 dev ens33`
- `ip addr show` to see information
- `ip route show` lists the current IPv4 routing table
- `sudo ip route add default via 192.168.0.1` add a default route via router 192.168.0.1

## IP v6

- `2001:0db8:0000:abcd:0000:0000:0000:7334` 8 groups of 16-bit (hexa :0 to f) = 128 bits

## IP v6 Prefix

- The first 64 bits of an IPv6 address are known as the **routing prefix**
