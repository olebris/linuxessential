---

## Sofware packages

- Each distro has a package repository
- Package manager
  - `dpkg` `apt` `apt-get` for Debian / Ubuntu / Mint
  - `rpm` `yum` `dnf` for Red Hat, Fedora , CentOS
  - `apt` `apt-get` `yum` `dnf` used for catalogues of packages with dependencies. Use this in practice. Manage packages, dependencies, future update
  - `dpkg` `rpm` operate only on individual package file (no dependencies). No use in practice

## Package Installation

- Search:
  - `apt-cache search package_name` or `apt search package_name`  
The `apt-cache` command is used to search for packages and to list
information about available packages
  - `yum search package_name` or `dnf search package_name`
- Install:
  - `sudo apt-get install package_name` or `sudo apt install package_name`
  - `sudo yum install package_name` or `sudo dnf install package_name`
  - `sudo`: Need to be `root` for installation

## Package removal

- `sudo apt-get remove package_name` or `sudo apt remove package_name` DEB packages
- `sudo yum remove package_name` or `sudo dnf remove package_name` RPM packages
- `sudo`: Need to be `root` for a removal

## Office applications
  
- Apache Foundation : *Apache OpenOffice* (Apache 2.0)
- Document Foundation : *LibreOffice* (LGPLv3)
- share the same code
- compatible with Microsoft format
- ODF is the open format (`.odt` for writer `.ods` for calc `.odp` for impress)
- Main Libreoffice/OpenOffice applications:
  - **Writer** for text similar to  Word
  - **Calc** for spreadsheet similar to Excel
  - **Impress** for presentations similar to PowerPoint
  - **Draw** for vector drawing similar to Visio
  - **Math** for formulas
  - **Base** for database similar to Access

## Web Browsers

- Firefox - Mozilla Organization - Open Source
- Chrome - proprietary based on open source browser : Chromium

## Multimedia

- Blender for 3D animations
- GIMP for image edition (~ Photoshop)
- Inkscape for vectors (~ Illustrator)
- Audacity for audio edition
- ImageMagick command tool for image and PDF transformation
- VLC for video

## Server programs

- http server (collect request from client browser and send a response mostly in HTML format through HTTP protocol) )
  - Apache
  - Nginx
  - lighthttpd
- PHP mostly use as server language
- Javascript as client language
- Static pages and Dynamic pages
- Dynamic pages : http server queries a database
- Database server : store large amount of organized information
- Relational database : `MariaDB` `MySQL` `PostgreSQL`

## Data sharing

- Network sharing
  - NFS (*Network File System*) - protocol for Unix/linux machines
  - NFS sometimes used by *thin clients* : OS is booted from distant directory with NFS
  - Samba for Linux / Windows/ other OS. Samba can share printers
- Network Domain
  - Domain controller is the central server used for workstation login
  - Domain controller is managed by Microsoft's Active Directory
  - Linux workstation use authentication system *SSSD* or Samba to be connected to Domain Controller
  - *NextCloud* or *ownCloud* :
    - NextCloud is a fork of ownCloud
    - **file sharing**, **collaborative workspaces**, calendar, contacts, emails
    - NextCloud : video conferencing
    - paid version : extra feature and support
    - run on private server (on premise)

## Network Administration

- for communication between computers
- need routers with network services:
  - DHCP *Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol*
    - Provide automatically an IP to the requesting device
  - DNS *Domain Name System*
    - translate domain name to IP
    - third party DNS : Google, OpenDNS

## Programming Languages

- Language : instructions used to make programs (applications, OS or server programs)
- *source code* in text files is a human friendly description of the program
- computer can't execute directly source code
  - *compiled language* use a compiler to convert source code in binary file executed by computer. Binary is specific to one processor type.
  - *interpreted language* or *scripting language* does not need compilation. An interpreter read source code in real time and execute instruction. Development is easier but execution is slower  
  
### JavaScript

- interpreted
- mostly used in web pages
- client oriented but now also server (node.js) ans mobile device (react native)

### C

- compiled in binary code
- used to build OS (Linux, Unix)
- flexible (work on different platform)

### Java

- compiled in bytecode for JVM
- portable

### Perl

- interpreted
- good to process text content w/ regular expressions

### Shell

- interpreted
- good to automate tasks on command line environment

### Python

- interpreted
- popular , easy to learn, good for scientific needs (dependencies like numpy/ pandas )

### PHP

- interpreted
- good for web dynamic content pages (server side)
- LAMP is very popular for web servers
