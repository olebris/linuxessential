# 1.1 Linux Evolution

## Introduction

- Linus Torvalds 1991  
- Inspired by UNIX - AT&T 1970s  
- Unix-like for x86 computers  
- No Unix code in Linux but same principles & ideas

## Distributions  

Distro = Linux Kernel + selection of applications for a certain use case or  user group  

### Distro families  

- **Debian** : Ian Murdock 1993 (wife Debbie = Debian)  - packages `.deb`
  - FSF / Stallman philosophy - freedom to run/study/distribute/improve the software  
    - No proprietary software by default  
    - **Ubuntu**: Mark Shuttleworth 2004  
      - Easy to use and configure desktop env.  
      - release every 6 months. LTS every 2 years
      - Linux Mint / Raspbian / Pop!_OS ...
- **RedHat** :started in 1994 Red Hat company - packages `.rpm`
  - rebranded RHEL in 2003
  - acquired by IBM in 2019
  - for professional server env.
  - fee-based subscriptions  / licenses
  - CentOS / Fedora are free
  - **Fedora** founded in 2003 aimed at desktop PC / very progressive / test-bed for RHEL  
- **SUSE** : 1994 in Germany packages `.rpm`
  - YaST & zypper config. tool (package + network + setup server)
  - **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server** : commercial edition
  - **openSUSE** 2004 is free
- Others :
  - Kali : Security
  - QubesOS : security
  - Docker (Alpine) : containers
  - Embedded systems or smart devices ...  

## Embedded systems  

Combination of hardware and software for a larger system  
Embedded software help to control a device and access the hardware  
Embedded software are mostly based on Linux kernel  

- **Android**
  - 2005 Google
  - OS Free / Open Source (but Gmail, Maps, Chrome, PlayStore ... are proprietary )
  - Smartphones, TVs, watches, tablets, set-top boxes, cameras
- **Raspbian**
  - distro from Debian family for Raspberry Pi - ARM based computer with no hard disk
  - Raspbian : started from a memory card
  - Raspberry PI : small ARM based computer with GPIO pins to attach electronics devices / extension boards
  - Platform for hardware development
- **Kodi**
  - distro for media center

## Cloud Computing

- Linux : 90% of the cloud workload
- AWS and GCP essentially but also Azure
- Linux is part of *IaaS* offering
- Cloud 'Instance' = a Linux image
- Cloud :
  - Flexibility (scaling is easier)
  - Easy to recover (backup / restore is easier)
  - Low use cost (you pay only what you use)
